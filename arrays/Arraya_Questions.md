## 🟢 Very Basic (Warm-up)

Start here to get comfortable with indexing and loops.

- Find the maximum element in an array  
- Find the minimum element in an array  
- Count the number of even and odd elements  
- Check if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order  
- Find the second largest element in an array

## 🟢 Basic Array Manipulation

These build confidence with in-place updates.

- Reverse an array in place  
- Rotate an array left by 1  
- Rotate an array right by k positions  
- Remove all occurrences of a given element  
- Move all zeros to the end while maintaining order

## 🟢 Two Pointer Foundation

These are extremely important for interviews.

- Remove duplicates from a sorted array  
- Find a pair with a given sum in a sorted array  
- Merge two sorted arrays  
- Square each element and return a sorted array  
- Reverse only the vowels in a string array

## 🟢 Hashing + Arrays (Easy)

Helps transition from brute force to optimal solutions.

- Find the frequency of each element  
- Find the first non-repeating element  
- Check if two arrays are equal (same elements, same frequency)  
- Find the intersection of two arrays  
- Find the union of two arrays

## 🟢 Sliding Window (Intro Level)

Very common in product companies.

- Find the maximum sum of subarray of size k  
- Find the minimum sum of subarray of size k  
- Check if there exists a subarray with sum = k  
- Count subarrays of size k with average > x  
- Find the longest subarray with all unique elements  

---

## 🟢 Edge-Case Practice (Important)

Interviewers love these.

- Handle an empty array  
- Handle an array with one element  
- Handle an array with all same elements  
- Handle negative numbers only  
- Handle mixed positive and negative numbers

## 🧠 How to Practice (Very Important)

For each problem:

- First write a brute force solution  
- Then try to optimize  
- Say time & space complexity out loud  
- Code cleanly, not fast
